# Subsequence's

In the context of a list (or an array) in data structures and algorithms, a subsequence is a sequence of elements that appears in the same order as the original sequence but not necessarily consecutively. In other words, a subsequence is a subset of elements obtained by deleting some elements from the original sequence without changing the relative order of the remaining elements.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The following are some of its subsequence's:

- `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `[1, 3, 4]`
- `[2, 4]`
- `[1, 2, 4]`
- ...

Note that each subsequence is obtained by selecting a subset of elements from the original list while maintaining their relative order. The length of a subsequence can vary from 0 (empty subsequence) to the length of the original sequence.
